# Ecliptor

**Eclipse your tokens. Vanish from the chain. Reappear when ready.**

## Project Description
Ecliptor is an experimental ERC20 token that introduces on-chain privacy through a novel "eclipse" mechanic. Users can temporarily remove their tokens from public visibility by "eclipsing" them — effectively burning visible tokens while preserving them in a hidden state. These tokens can later be restored or transferred stealthily without ever appearing in public balances.

Perfect for privacy enthusiasts, stealth airdrops, dark pool–like transfers, or simply disappearing from rich lists.

## Project Vision
To bring optional, reversible privacy to Ethereum without complex zero-knowledge proofs.  
Ecliptor proves that meaningful privacy can be achieved with simple, auditable Solidity — no mixers, no tornadoes, just an eclipse.

> "In the shadow of the blockchain, true freedom emerges."

## Key Features
- **Eclipse**: Hide your entire balance (appears as 0 on explorers)
- **Uneclipse**: Restore your tokens at any time
- **Stealth Transfer**: Transfer tokens between eclipsed users without ever exposing balances
- Standard ERC20 compatibility when not eclipsed
- Fully auditable & upgradable by owner (future proxy possible)

## Future Scope
- Governance-controlled eclipse fees (tax during eclipse/uneclipse)
- Time-locked eclipse (commitment schemes)
- Eclipse-to-earn staking rewards while hidden
- Integration with privacy dApps and dark forests
- ZK-friendly version (Ecliptor Zero)
- Cross-chain eclipse via LayerZero/CCIP

**The eclipse is just the beginning.**
